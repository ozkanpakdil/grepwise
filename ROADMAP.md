# GrepWise Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

GrepWise is an open-source alternative to Splunk, designed for log analysis and monitoring. The project aims to provide a powerful, user-friendly platform for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing log data with features similar to Splunk but with an open-source approach.

## Current Status

The project has been successfully initialized with:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot application with gRPC services for logs, alarms, and authentication
- **Frontend**: React application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **Build System**: Maven configuration for the backend
- **API Definitions**: Protocol Buffer definitions for gRPC services

## Next Steps for Backend Development

### 1. Implement Core Log Ingestion (High Priority)

- [x] Create log collectors for common sources (files, syslog, HTTP)
- [x] Implement log parsing and normalization
- [ ] Develop a buffering system for high-volume log ingestion
- [x] Add support for various log formats (JSON, XML, plain text)

### 2. Enhance Search Capabilities (High Priority)

- [x] Implement a query language similar to Splunk's SPL
- [ ] Develop indexing for fast search performance
- [x] Add support for field extraction and search-time field creation
- [ ] Implement search commands (stats, eval, where, etc.)

### 3. Storage and Retention (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Implement a storage layer for log data (consider options like Elasticsearch, ClickHouse, or custom solution)
- [ ] Add configurable retention policies
- [ ] Implement data compression and archiving
- [ ] Develop a mechanism for data partitioning

### 4. Alerting System (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Complete the alarm service implementation
- [ ] Add support for various notification channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
- [ ] Implement scheduled searches
- [ ] Add support for alert throttling and grouping

### 5. User Management and Security (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Enhance the authentication service
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add support for LDAP/Active Directory integration
- [ ] Implement audit logging

### 6. API Enhancements (Low Priority)

- [ ] Create REST API endpoints alongside gRPC services
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and throttling

## Next Steps for Frontend Development

### 1. Complete Search Interface (High Priority)

- [ ] Implement the Monaco Editor for search queries
- [ ] Develop syntax highlighting for the query language
- [ ] Create a results table with sorting and filtering
- [ ] Add visualization options for search results

### 2. Dashboard Creation (High Priority)

- [ ] Implement a dashboard designer
- [ ] Add support for various visualization types (charts, tables, gauges)
- [ ] Create a layout system for arranging visualizations
- [ ] Implement dashboard sharing and export

### 3. Alarm Management UI (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Complete the alarm creation interface
- [ ] Implement an alarm monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add support for acknowledging and resolving alerts
- [ ] Create notification preferences UI

### 4. User Management UI (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create user administration screens
- [ ] Implement role and permission management
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Implement audit log viewer

### 5. Settings and Configuration (Low Priority)

- [x] Create system configuration UI
- [x] Implement data source management
- [ ] Add index and field configuration
- [ ] Create backup and restore UI

### 6. Mobile Responsiveness (Low Priority)

- [ ] Enhance mobile layouts for all screens
- [ ] Optimize visualizations for small screens
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Create a progressive web app configuration

## Integration Steps

### 1. Backend-Frontend Integration

- [ ] Implement gRPC-Web for browser-to-backend communication
- [x] Create API client libraries for the frontend
- [x] Implement authentication token handling
- [ ] Add real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

### 2. External System Integration

- [ ] Develop integrations with common log sources (nginx, Apache, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for cloud provider logs (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, etc.)
- [ ] Implement integrations with alerting systems (PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.)
- [ ] Create export capabilities to other systems

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing

- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests for backend services
- [ ] Create unit tests for frontend components
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing

### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Develop integration tests for backend services
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Implement performance testing for search and ingestion

### 3. Load Testing

- [ ] Create benchmarks for log ingestion performance
- [ ] Test search performance under load
- [ ] Evaluate system resource usage under various conditions

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Containerization

- [ ] Create Docker configurations for backend and frontend
- [ ] Develop Docker Compose setup for local deployment
- [ ] Implement Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment

### 2. Scaling

- [ ] Design horizontal scaling for log ingestion
- [ ] Implement sharding for search services
- [ ] Create a distributed architecture for high availability

### 3. Monitoring
