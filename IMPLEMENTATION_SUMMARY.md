# Implementation Summary

## Plugin System Implementation

In the previous session, I implemented the missing methods in the `PluginRegistry` class to complete the plugin system's lifecycle management functionality:

1. `getPlugin(String pluginId)` - Returns a plugin by its ID
   ```java
   public Plugin getPlugin(String pluginId) {
       return getPluginById(pluginId).orElse(null);
   }
   ```

2. `getPlugins(Class<T> pluginType)` - Returns all plugins of the specified type
   ```java
   public <T extends Plugin> List<T> getPlugins(Class<T> pluginType) {
       return getPluginsByType(pluginType);
   }
   ```

3. `startAllPlugins()` - Starts all plugins
   ```java
   public void startAllPlugins() {
       logger.info("Starting all plugins");
       getAllPlugins().forEach(plugin -> {
           try {
               logger.info("Starting plugin: {} ({})", plugin.getName(), plugin.getId());
               plugin.start();
           } catch (Exception e) {
               logger.error("Error starting plugin: {} ({})", plugin.getName(), plugin.getId(), e);
           }
       });
   }
   ```

4. `stopAllPlugins()` - Stops all plugins
   ```java
   public void stopAllPlugins() {
       logger.info("Stopping all plugins");
       getAllPlugins().forEach(plugin -> {
           try {
               logger.info("Stopping plugin: {} ({})", plugin.getName(), plugin.getId());
               plugin.stop();
           } catch (Exception e) {
               logger.error("Error stopping plugin: {} ({})", plugin.getName(), plugin.getId(), e);
           }
       });
   }
   ```

I also fixed the test setup in `PluginRegistryTest.java` by removing the reflection-based approach to set the applicationContext field, as it was no longer needed, and updated the tests to properly test the newly implemented methods.

## Roadmap Status

The plugin system was already marked as completed in the ROADMAP.md file:
```
- [x] Create plugins system for custom integrations - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive plugin system with lifecycle management, dynamic loading, and type-safe registry
```

I didn't update the roadmap status because the plugin system was already marked as completed. However, I've now updated the description to better reflect the specific implementation details:
```
- [x] Create plugins system for custom integrations - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive plugin system with lifecycle management (including plugin initialization, starting, stopping), dynamic loading, and type-safe registry with methods for retrieving plugins by ID and type
```

## Next Steps

The next unimplemented features in the roadmap are:
1. Implement an app marketplace (line 238)
2. Implement multi-tenancy (line 243)
3. Develop compliance reporting (line 245)

These features can be implemented in future sessions.
